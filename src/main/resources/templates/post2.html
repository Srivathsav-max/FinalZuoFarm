                            <h2 class="post-title">WHY ADOPT AGRICULTURAL DRONES?</h2>
                        </a>
			<p>Drone technology has gotten most of the recognition in the industry because of its diversity and considered the future for the agrarian community. The military initially used them. However, other sectors quickly embraced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) when they learned about its widespread applications.
How can drones support Indian agriculture? Drones don't merely enhance overall performance but also encourage farmers to solve other assorted barriers and receive plenty of benefits through precision agriculture. With the market for agricultural drones reaching a whopping $1.3 billion, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) fill the gap of human error and inefficiency by traditional farming methods. The purpose of adopting drone technology is to exclude any guesswork or ambiguity and instead focus on accurate and reliable information.
External factors like weather, soil conditions, and temperature play a critical role in farming. Agriculture drone empowers the farmer to adapt to specific environments and make mindful choices accordingly. The gained data helps regulate crop health, crop treatment, crop scouting, irrigation, and carry out field soil analysis and crop damage assessments. The drone survey helps boost crop yields and minimize time and expenses.</p>

<p>According to experts, the predicted world population will be 9 billion by 2050. Agricultural consumption is also said to increase simultaneously by nearly 70%. Drone technology, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and remote sensing features, are rising in demand because of its advantages. The central government has acknowledged the importance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), machine learning, and artificial intelligence with their 'Digital Sky Platform' online. Drone startups in India have used this opportunity to accomplish better technological capacities.</p>

		</p>Only after complete recognition of drones characteristics can one gain in-depth knowledge about agriculture drones. Typically, drones include a navigation system, GPS, multiple sensors, high-quality cameras, programmable controllers, and tools for autonomous drones. The DJI is one such familiar drone utilized by the industry. Most farmers currently use satellite imagery as an introductory guide for farm management. Furnished with modern technology, Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can get more precise data than satellites for precision agriculture. They then process the data captured into agri-tech software to produce beneficial knowledge</p>
		<h3 class="blog-small-sub-heading">Capturing data from agriculture drone takes place as in the following stages</h3>
		<span class="bold-font">1. Analyzing the area:</span>
<p>This identifies the territory being tested. Therefore, the first step includes establishing a boundary, analyses of the area, and then finally, uploading the technical GPS information into the drone's navigation system.</p>
<img src="assets/img/blog/drone-3.jpg" alt="Anime of drone" width="700" height="300">
<span class="bold-font">2. Using Autonomous Drones: </span>
<p>Since Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are independent, they enter flight patterns into their already established system to collect required data.</p>
<span class="bold-font">3. Uploading the data: </span>
<p>After capturing all the required data through sensors such as the multispectral sensor/RGB sensor, it is processed through numerous software for further analysis and interpretation.</p>
<span class="bold-font">4. Output: </span>
<p>After collecting the data, they format it so that farmers can understand the data with no hassle, bringing them a step closer to precision farming. 3D mapping or Photogrammetry are popular methods to display extensive data collected.</p>
<h2 class="blog-heading">BEST DRONE PRACTICES</h2>
<span class="bold-font">Drone technology</span>
<p>quickly reestablishes traditional agrarian practices and is subsequently accomplishing them as follows</p>
<span class="bold-font">1. Irrigation Monitoring:</span>
<img src="assets/img/blog/drone-4.jpg" alt="Anime of drone" width="700" height="300">
<p>Drones, including hyperspectral, thermal, or multispectral sensors, recognize areas that are too dry or need improvement by the farmer. Drone survey helps improve water efficiency and disclose potential pooling/leaks in irrigation by providing Irrigation monitoring yields calculations of the vegetation index to help realize the health of crops and emitted heat/energy.</p>
<span class="bold-font">2. Crop Damage Assessment</span>
<img src="assets/img/blog/drone-5.jpg" alt="Anime of drone" width="700" height="300">
<p>Agricultural drones fitted along with multispectral sensors and RGB sensors also detect field areas inflicted by weeds, infections, and pests. According to this data, the exact amounts of chemicals needed to fight these infestations are known, and this helps diminish the costs inflicted by the farmer.</p>
<span class="bold-font">3. Agricultural spraying</span>
<img src="assets/img/blog/drone-6.jpg" alt="Anime of drone" width="700" height="300">
<p>Through drone crop spraying, human contact with such harmful chemicals is limited. Agri-drones can carry out this task much quicker than vehicles/airplanes. Drones with RGB sensors and multispectral sensors can precisely identify and treat problematic areas. Professionals say that aerial spraying is five times faster with drones when compared to other methods.</p>
