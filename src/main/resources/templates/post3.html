<p><strong>1- Background: </strong>On 5 June 2020, the  Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 was promulgated by the Union Cabinet. </p>
<p><strong>2- Act: </strong>It is an act of the Indian Parliament that was enacted in 1955 to ensure the delivery of certain commodities or products, the supply of which if obstructed owing to hoarding or black-marketing would affect the normal life of the people. This includes foodstuff, drugs, fuel (petroleum products) etc.</p>
<p>strong>3- Powers of Central Government:</strong></p>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> The Government of India regulates the production, supply, and distribution of a whole host of commodities it declares ‘essential’ in order to make them available to consumers at fair prices.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> The Government can also fix the MRP of any packaged product that it declares an 'essential commodity'.</p>
<p><strong>(c)</strong> The Centre can add commodities to this list when the need arises and can take them off the list once the situation improves.</p>
<p><strong>(d)</strong> If a certain commodity is in short supply and its price is spiking, the Government can notify stock-holding limits on it for a specified period.</p>
<p><strong>4- Powers of State Government: </strong>The respective State Governments can choose not to impose any restrictions as notified by the Centre. However, if the restrictions are imposed, traders have to immediately sell any stocks held beyond the mandated quantity into the market. This is done to improve supplies and brings down prices. </p>

<p><strong>5- Amendment: </strong>With the amendment in the Act, the Government of India will list certain commodities as essential to regulate their supply and prices only in cases of war, famine, extraordinary price rises, or natural calamities. The commodities that have been deregulated are food items, including cereals, pulses, potatoes, onions, edible oilseeds, and oils.</p>

<p><strong>6- Stock Limit: </strong>As per the amendment, the imposition of any stock limit on agricultural produce will be based on price rise and can only be imposed if there's-- a 100% increase in the retail price of horticultural produce and a 50% increase in the retail price of non-perishable agricultural food items. </p>

<p><strong>7- Calculation: </strong>The increase will be calculated over the price prevailing immediately preceding twelve months, or the average retail price of the last five years, whichever is lower.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that these restrictions will not be applied to stocks of food held for public distribution in India.</p>
